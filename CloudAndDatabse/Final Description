The objective of the project was to develop the starting proof-of-concept of a web page with database backend that would support a 
coordination of Drake volunteer hours. The first step to completing this task was opening up a new EC2 instance. To keep track of all 
the data information I started a MySQL server. In the server, I chose to create two tables one for people’s credentials, called person, 
and the second one to contain all their volunteer information called volounteerhours. The primary key for the first one was the student 
id and the second table was an auto incremented id number. If needed the tables could be joined by student ID’s. The next part was creating 
a user-friendly html page for students to enter information. The first page, http://18.205.105.81/login.html, is for first time users. 
The HTML contains labels for student id, first name, last name, and email. On the page, I added a link to the hours’ submission page, 
http://18.205.105.81/hoursForm.html, to allow returning users to log their hours without having to register again. Once a record is added 
it will take them to another page, where the user can click on the link to take them to the hours submission page. The links were made 
using href attributes in <a> tags. Aesthetic improvements included centering the text, adding an image of the Drake logo, and adding 
breaks after certain lines. To do this a center tag was used <center>, <img src> for the image, and <br> for the line breaks. The hoursForm 
page was where all the valuable information was retrieved from. This page was made similarly to the first one except corresponded 
with the volounteerhours table. The hoursForm page also had a link to the first page if a new user somehow got on this page first, 
maybe if a friend sent them the link. Additionally, this page has a button to search for total hours for each student id. Originally, 
I had it display all information, but I thought the most important information for the user is the total hours. 
Only the Id is show so only individuals with their id number can view their hours giving privacy to other users. If I had more 
time to complete this project I would provide a search function so a user can only view their own information. I would also add 
hours per volunteer location. Much of my project involved storing the information effectively while making it easy for the user. 
The website could contain an admin option to view all information of the tables and add different sorting options.
